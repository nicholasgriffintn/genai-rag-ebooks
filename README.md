# GenAI RAG eBooks Chatbot

This is a personal project to investigate more around GenAI and RAG to create a chatbot that can interact with eBooks.

The aim of this was mainly to investigate Cloudflare Workers with Python, however, as I used it, I found out that they're not really ready yet.

The Workers AI binding doesn't seem to work (maybe that's a skill issue) and you can't use requirements.txt files yet, so can't use requests.

You can find the code for this project here: (TODO: Add link)

## Getting Started

- Run with `npx wrangler@latest dev`
- It should start on `http://localhost:8787`
